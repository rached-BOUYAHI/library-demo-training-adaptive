In case you run into difficulties with submitting the flag, try to Log out and Log in again. \n\n| Level | Level Name | Level Type |\n|:------:|------| ------ |\n| 1. | Info | Info |\n| 2. | Finding Open Ports | Game |\n| 3. | Connecting via Telnet | Game |\n| 4. | Privilege Escalation | Game |\n| 5. | Test Example | Assessment |\n| 6. | Assessment Example | Assessment |\n\n## Info\n\nThe level contains this information page.\n\n## Finding open ports\n\nThe level provides information on how to connect to a sandbox. In general, there are two possible options. The first option is to use the platform'a GUI to connect to the machine via Spice console. The second option is to connect through SSH with a generated config file and keys.\n\nThis level's small challenge is to scan open ports.\n\n## Connecting Via Telnet\n\nThis level's challenge is to connect to the server machine without a password and discover the secret flag.\n\n## Privilege Escalation\n\nThis demo's bigger challenge is to gain root privileges and read a flag available only to a root user. Enjoy! \n\n## Test Example\n\nThe level contains a simple example of a test. Tests can be used, for example, for additional testing of students for grading purposes.\n\n## Assessment Example\n\nThe level contains a simple example of a test. For example, the tests can be used to verify the learning outcomes or for collecting feedback.\n"
